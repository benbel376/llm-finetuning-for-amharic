# Code of Conduct

## Overview

Welcome to the **LLM Finetuning: Enabling Quality Embedding and Text Generation for Amharic Language** repository. To ensure a positive and inclusive environment for all contributors, we have established this Code of Conduct. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

-   Using welcoming and inclusive language.
-   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
-   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
-   Focusing on what is best for the community.
-   Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

-   The use of offensive or derogatory language.
-   Harassment, trolling, or other forms of personal attacks.
-   Public or private harassment based on any of the aforementioned factors.
-   Any form of discrimination.

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [your email]. The project team will review and investigate all complaints and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within the project space and when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing the project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by the project maintainers.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.
